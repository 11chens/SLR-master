### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

#### üöÄ Pipeline to Install and Train SLR

**Note**: Before running our code, it's highly recommended to first familiarize yourself with the [RSL's Legged Gym version](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) to get a basic understanding of the Isaac-LeggedGym-RslRL framework.

---

#### 1. Create an environment and install PyTorch

```bash
conda create -n slr python=3.8
conda activate slr
pip install torch==2.4.1 torchvision==0.15.3 torchaudio==2.0.2
```

---

#### 2. Install Isaac Gym (Preview 4 release)

Download and install from [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym):

```
cd isaacgym/python && pip install -e .
```

Test the installation by running an example:

```
cd examples && python 1080_balls_of_solitude.py
```

---

#### 3. Clone this repository and install packages:

```
git clone git@github.com:11chens/SLR-master.git
```

Ensure you have installed the following packages:

```
pip install .

```

---

#### 4. Try Training the Model

You can use the `--headless` flag to disable the GUI. Press "v" to pause/resume GUI playback.

```
python train.py
```

---

#### 5. Play the Trained Policy

```
python play.py
```
